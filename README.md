<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project was developed as part of our final assignment for the semester, with the goal of creating a Rock Paper Scissors (Jokenpô) game using the Python programming language. The game was implemented to function in three distinct modes:

Player vs. Player

Player vs. Robot

Robot vs. Robot

The main objective of this project was to implement the game logic in Python, create a simple and intuitive interface, and allow users to interact dynamically with the system. The game supports Player vs. Player, Player vs. Robot, and Robot vs. Robot modes, offering different ways to play.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
Player vs. Player Mode: Allows two players to play a round of Rock Paper Scissors, taking turns to make their moves.

Player vs. Robot Mode: The human player competes against a robot that makes random choices.

Robot vs. Robot Mode: Two robots automatically play against each other, with the results displayed after each round.
